  * Dashboard widget (for access from other macs)
  * A full security review by Someone Who Knows

### Tapp Developers ###
To make all of the apps feel refined, we'd like to get developers who'd be interested in working on each area:

  * Server - jnjitkoff
  * Menu - gmurphy/jnjitkoff
  * Screen/VNC - ???
  * File Browser - ???
  * Camera - bwhitman
  * Remote - Neil D.
  * _Spotlight_ - ksmarshall

Let us know if you are interested in contributing to any of these or if you have an app that we should include in the application.
